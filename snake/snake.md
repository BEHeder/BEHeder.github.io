    Under Construction
    <br>
    Constructing this game follows the tutorial at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/think-like-a-programmer-how-to-build-snake-using-only-javascript-html-and-css-7b1479c3339e">Think like a programmer: How to build Snake using only JavaScript, HTML & CSS</a>, with additional help from other resources. To be honest, the Free Code Camp article has typos and such, making it a little difficult to follow.
